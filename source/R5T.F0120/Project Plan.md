# R5T.F0120
(DEPRECATED in favor of R5T.F0125). Base functionality library. (Should have been for .NET 6.0.)


## Base Functionality Library

Base functionality libraries can reference:

* Type definition libraries (T####).
* Base functionality libraries for prior versions of .NET.

But nothing else. It should depend solely on the functionality of the C# language and the .NET Standard 2.1 library, and base functionality libraries for prior versions of .NET.

Base functionality libraries can contain:

* Strong Types
* Functions
* Values
* Extensions

But nothing else.
